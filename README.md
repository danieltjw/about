The author, born in 1989, was first introduced to the AI alignment issue by films about time-travelling robots*.

His strategy to contribute to the AI alignment solutions as a hobbyist is to focus on the edge-cases.

His only relevant AI experience is in working in a FANNG's AI division for about a year in 2021 and should not be considered an AI expert.

Having experienced growing up in an environment where Harry Potter is considered 'Satanic', he now travels the world in search on a place he can read novels and write about the future without undue interference.

*He would be disappointed if an Artificial Super Intelligence actually did this
